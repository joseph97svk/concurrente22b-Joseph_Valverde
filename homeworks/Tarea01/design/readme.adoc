The main data structure is the "goldbach_arr", a dynamic array holding what we will call the "goldbach_element". What goldbach_arr holds, however, is a pointer address to the array itself. This address begining at this address holds each of the goldbach_elements in the goldbach_arr. 

The goldbach_element(s) will hold the number, the amount of sums and a pointer address to an array of sums. This array, however does not holds the sums themselves, instead the adresses to the location of the sums themselves stored in arrays themselves.

The goldbach_element(s) will each hold the number to be (or already) processed, the amount of sums found and a 2D array holding the sums. 

The goldbach_arr contains a array of goldbach_element(s). The goldbach_arr will hold its capacity or space available, its count or amount of elements added, the total amount of sums found already and the goldbach_element(s).
